step 1: implement your own image effect/blit render feature, or just import this one https://github.com/Cyanilux/URP_BlitRenderFeature.git

step 2: make sure your render camera and display camera don't use the same renderer, you only want to be adding the image effects to the render camera

step 3: create a new layer named "Display Camera"

step 4: add the "Force Depth Normals" render feature to the render camera renderer, only necessary for the outline

step 5: to use either feature, add a blit render feature and assign the appropriate material

the shaders work perfectly in buil-in as well, just use built in's version of blit which you do through a c# script
